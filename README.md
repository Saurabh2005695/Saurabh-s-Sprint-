## Getting Started

### Option 1: One-Click Windows Launcher (Easiest)

Double-click **`Play_Saurabhs_Sprint.bat`** — it starts the server and opens the game in your browser automatically.

### Option 2: Node.js Server

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <repository-url>
cd "Saurabh's Sprint"

# Start the local game server
node server.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:3001/` in your browser.

### Option 3: Standalone HTML (No server needed)

Open **`Saurabhs_Sprint_Standalone.html`** directly in any modern browser. No installation or server required — everything is self-contained in one file.

### Option 4: Vite Dev Server (For developers)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Vite development server
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

---

## Production Build

```bash
# Build optimized bundle to /dist
npm run build
```

The compiled static assets will be output to the `dist/` directory.
